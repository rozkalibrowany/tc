# The configuration file is one variant of an INI format https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI
# Both the hash sign (#) and semicolon (;) are allowed as comment markers when the comment starts the line.
# However, if the comment is inline with regular values, only the semicolon is allowed to introduce the comment.

# If you need to modify new option, it's convenient to use command
# ansible-config init -t all > tmp.cfg
# to generate all default options and copy what you need from there.

[defaults]
# (pathspec) Colon separated paths in which Ansible will search for Roles.
roles_path=~/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles:roles
# (string) Sets the macro for the 'ansible_managed' variable available for M(ansible.builtin.template) and M(ansible.windows.win_template) modules.  This is only relevant for those two modules.
ansible_managed=Warnig!!!! Ansible managed, do not edit directly. Any changes made to this file will be lost after the next ansible run.
